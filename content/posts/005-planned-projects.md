Quick list of projects I'm planning/working on.

## Active

Projects I'm actively working on.

### 1. Legend of Code

This very blog you're looking at, if you even exist. Hi there!

### 2. Budgeteer

Something to plan budgets with, but not really. Maybe more of a networth visualiser. This is based on a patchwork of various code snippets and SQL scripts I've cobbled together over the years so I could check my current liquidity and put together a rough budget. Doesn't work very well because it requires too many manual steps.

So yes, it is used to plan a budget. But what it actually does is just create a visualisation of my assets and liabilities. I should probably do some needs gathering and properly define whatever the hell it is I want to build. It's probably multiple projects in one because it originally stemmed from a RECORD-ALL-THE-THINGS! kind of project that was equally as well defined and definitely didn't suffer from scope creep or anything.

I don't intend to monetise or sell this thing so it is basically my little tech playground.

### 3. SnowboardGP

Essentially my snowboarding blog but is something I think has a slight chance of generating some side income.

Essentially a simple visual map of all the ski resorts in Japan and a trip planner. Changes to the Google Maps pricing has complicated things a little.

Just a little.

### 4. Kutsurogi 
Home refactoring project. I should probably blog about it.

## Icebox

Stuff that's I've stopped working on for now.

### 5. Okra
Dashboard and visualisations for OKRs

### 6. Libraga
Static site generator with a CMS. Something I made to learn nodejs. Never finished, probably never will.

### 7. GitSee
Git GUI - A git that you can see.
