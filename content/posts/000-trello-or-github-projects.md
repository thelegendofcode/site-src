I've traditionally used Trello for managing projects, on and off line. I'm not sure when or why, but I've stopped updating my board sometime this year.

Now that I'm trying to be more active with the whole [Legend of Code] thing, I've found myself searching for another project management tool.

I've used several tools over my career, no point listing them all so these are my top three.

## [Wrike]

Wrike is the most powerful project mangement tool I've ever used.

*list things I liked about wrike*
iOS app is really nice to use

*list things I dislike about wrike*
- expensive
- probably a bit too powerful, it's sometimes confusing to use

## [Trello]

Trello is a lot more simpler and limited compared to Wrike, but its simplicity is probably its largest selling point.

## [Github Projects]

*list things I liked about github projects*
Github

*list things I dislike about github projects*
no app
iOS support is janky
