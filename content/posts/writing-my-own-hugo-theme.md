There're billions upon billions of very well made themes for Hugo out there, so it's a huge waste of my time to even attempt writing my own. Time that can be well spent working on Budgeteer or SnowboardGP or Kutsurogi or Okra or Libraga, and so on. I have **so** many ideas, all of them barely touched upon.

> I DO NOT HAVE THE THE TIME TO WRITE MY OWN THEME!

Said I, at the beginning of this year. You see, this blog was supposed to be launched on 1st of Jan, 2019. Then It was 'delayed' till the 15th of April. Then again till 10th of May.

But it wasn't.

Because I couldn't find a theme I was satisfied with. So I kept tinkering and dwiddling, finding one that was almost right and then trying to customise it to `$MY_UNIQUE_NEEDS`.

Until eventually, I settled on [KISS](https://github.com/ribice/kiss). It still has a few nigs and nags, it's not 100%, it's probably not even 80%. But It Just Worksâ„¢.

So I'll going to make my own one anyway.
