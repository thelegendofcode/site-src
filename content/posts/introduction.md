I have been trying to write this intro for the past month now but I haven't been able to write anything satisfactory, so this is pure stream of consciousness.

I'm setting up this journal to record my thought processes as I develop some apps for my own personal use. Hopefully it may prove useful to someone out there. At the very least, it should serve as a reminder of the mistakes I'll make and any lessons I learn.

I'll try to write at least once a week.
